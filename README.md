## KS_V3S

I have designed this PCB, because the sheer power of this SoC, at very low power consumption, combined with its display capabilities, it offers options that makers have never seen before.

There is one version available: the 2 layer version.
Have a look at the subfolder for the 2 layer version to check out the specific features.

The KS_V3S:<br>
• SoC Allwinner V3s:<br>
	- ARM Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz<br>
	- 64 Megabyte of RAM<br>
•	Wifi and Bluetooth (RTL8723BS)  <br>
•	1 USB Host Port / 1 Type-C USB port <br> 
•	DVP interface<br>
•	pinheader for an OV2640 and an OV7725 parallel camera<br>
•	ST7789V displays<br>
•	onboard microphone<br>
•	SD card slot<br>

The KS_V3S can only boot from an SD card . <br>
I'm currently <b> not </B> available for custom projects. <br>
